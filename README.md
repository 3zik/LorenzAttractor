# Lorenz Attractor

The Lorenz Attractor is a set of ODEs.  It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions.  This underscores that chaotic systems can be completely deterministic and yet still be inherently impractical or even impossible to predict over longer periods of time.  This program models and animates the solutions to these equations.  The results depend directly on the intial conditions.


The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations:

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
